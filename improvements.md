# GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements: Task Summary

This file summarizes the actionable tasks for improving GitHub Actions workflows in the `yml-change-webhook-trigger` repository. Tasks are grouped by implementation phase for incremental adoption.

---

## Phase 1: High Impact, Low Risk

- [ ] **Consolidate Workflows**
  - Remove `.github/workflows/release.yml` (keep `release-workflow.yml`)
  - Ensure all release steps are preserved in the consolidated workflow
- [ ] **Caching Improvements**
  - Enhance Node.js and build artifact caching with precise keys
  - Cache Jest and other build/test artifacts
- [ ] **Optimize Workflow Triggers**
  - Refine path and branch filters to avoid unnecessary runs
  - Add branch exclusions and specific path patterns
- [ ] **Documentation Comments**
  - Add detailed comments to workflow files
  - Create/expand documentation for workflows and their integration points

---

## Phase 2: Medium Complexity

- [ ] **Webhook Execution Enhancements**
  - Add retry logic, timeout handling, and response validation to webhook execution
  - Improve payload detail and error reporting
- [ ] **Error Handling & Reporting**
  - Add Slack notifications for workflow failures/successes
  - Implement summary/error reports for stakeholders
- [ ] **Parallelization for Performance**
  - Use matrix strategy for Node.js versions in tests
  - Run independent jobs/steps in parallel
  - Add concurrency controls to prevent workflow conflicts
- [ ] **Version Management Improvements**
  - Enhance detection of breaking changes (PR title/body, commit messages)
  - Improve semantic release logic in version bump workflow

---

## Phase 3: More Complex Changes

- [ ] **Security Scanning**
  - Add CodeQL and npm audit to workflows
  - Create a scheduled security audit workflow
- [ ] **Dependabot & Dependency Updates**
  - Add `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated updates
  - Create auto-merge workflow for Dependabot PRs
- [ ] **Environment-Specific Configurations**
  - Centralize environment variable management
  - Use GitHub Environments for secrets and config separation
